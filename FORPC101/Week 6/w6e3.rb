Here are the program specifications for a simple game to be played
against the computer.

a. This game is played at the command-line.
b. The game starts when the computer selects three consecutive cells in a 7 cell
row (from 0 to 6). When that's complete, the game asks for your first guess.
c. Guess the computer's selected cells in the smallest number of guesses. You are
 given a rating or level, based on how well you perform.
d. At the command line, the user types in a number from 0 to 6. The computer
checks if it's one of the selected cells. If it's a hit, increment the no_of_hits
variable. In response to your guess, you'll see a result at the command-line:
either "Hit", "Miss" or "End".
e. When you have guessed all three cells, the game ends by printing out your rating
(your number of guesses).

Note:
a. Use only the features we have learned so far, in Ruby.
b. You must design the GameBoard class.
c. The testgameboard.rb program uses your GameBoard class
