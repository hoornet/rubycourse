# => Exercise2.

This exercise thanks to Kathy Sierra. Once upon a time in a software
shop, two programmers were given the same spec and told to "build it".
The Really Annoying Project Manager forced the two coders to compete, by promising
that whoever delivers first gets one of those cool Aeron chairs all the Silicon
Valley guys have. The spec. There will be shapes on a GUI, a square, a circle and
a triangle. When the user clicks on a shape, the shape will rotate clockwise
360 degrees (ie. all the way around) and play an AIF sound file specific to that
 particular shape. Go for it guys and show me your code.

Note: This exercise is about inheritance, method overriding and method overloading
not about UI.
