=begin
  Write a Ruby program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
  But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
  and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are
  multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". Discuss
  this in the FizzBuzz Forum.
=end

1.upto(100) do |i|
  puts i
  
  
end
