Objective: To build a console (non UI), text-based adventure game. Adventure games are full of objects – everything
from the locations (‘Rooms’) to the Treasures they contain. This project is thanks to Huw Collingbourne.

Milestone1: The first task is to decide on the main classes which will define the objects in the game.
Most game objects – whether they are Rooms, Treasures, Weapons or Monsters – must have at least two properties:
a name and a description. Start by creating a base class, called Thing, from which more specialized classes will
 descend. Write the relevant methods so that the two attributes are accessible outside of the class.

Example usage of the Thing class:

# t = Thing.new(‘Satish’, ‘Ruby Evangelist’)

Milestone 2: Let’s move on to create some more specific descendant classes.

   1. The Room class is just a Thing but it adds on some ‘exit’ attributes. These attributes will be used to indicate
   which room, if any, is located at the North, South, West and East exits of the current room.

Example usage of the Room class:

# N S W E

@r0 = Room.new("Treasure Room", "a fabulous golden chamber", -1, 2, -1, 1)

@r1 = Room.new("Dragon's Lair", "a huge and glittering lair", -1, -1, 0, -1)

@r2 = Room.new("Troll Cave", "a dank and gloomy cave", 0, -1, -1, 3)

@r3 = Room.new("Crystal Dome", "a vast dome of glass", -1, -1, 2, -1)

# 0, 1, 2, 3 above indicate where Rooms @r0…@r3 are located

The rooms are located in these positions -

Room 0 Room 1

Room 2 Room 3

Now the code statement:
# the numbers indicate positions N S W E
@r0 = Room.new("Treasure Room", "a fabulous golden chamber", -1, 2, -1, 1)

indicates that to the North of Room 0, there is no Room i.e. -1 in the code. To the South of Room 0, there is
Room 2 i.e. 2 in the code. To the East of Room 0 is Room 1 i.e. 1 in the code and to the West of Room 0 is
 no room i.e. -1 in the code.

   2. Any adventure game needs a map (a collection of Rooms). For the sake of simplicity, the Map class will simply
   be a class that contains an array of rooms. You could, of course, use the default Ruby Array class for this purpose.
   Or you could make the Map class a descendant of Array. Let us not use the plain Array class for the simple reason
   that you might want to add special behavior to the Map at a later date. Other reasons are:

1. We don’t want our code to have access to the whole range of Array methods when we use a Map object and

2. We may decide to change the Map class in a later revision of the code
 (the Ruby ‘Hash’ class – a key/value ‘dictionary’ – could be used).

Example usage of the Map class:

# @map = Map.new(someRooms)

   3. The adventure game also needs a Player (to provide the first person perspective as you move through the game).
   We could create a special one-off class for the Player. However, we’ve decided that we may need more than one object
   with the ability to move through the game (maybe we’ll make it multi-player or maybe we’ll add some ‘characters’ who
    can move around through the game environment) which is why we’ve create a more generic class called Actor.
     This class has a position attribute to indicate which room it is in at any given moment.

Example usage of the Actor class:

# thePlayer = Actor.new("The Player", "You", 0)
